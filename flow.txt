--------------------------------------------------
Now the client has everything it needs to ball out
--------------------------------------------------
WRITE-SIDE
Store and display current mode in toolbar (unencrypted, encrypted for a specific person)
Frontend & backend to select a contact from contacts list.
Facebook handler to guess what mode you should be in (if you haven't specifically manually selected a mode already)
Based on current mode, intercept key strokes, and output them to DOM appropriately
Frontend to make your output look sexier than cipher_text.

READ-SIDE
Find truespeak tags in the DOM with your username.
Try to decrypt truespeak tags for you using your private key.
