            <p style="font-size:24px;"> Feel free to <a href="http://mail.google.com">go straight to gmail</a> and try it out, but we recommend
                checking out the tutorial below (it's short).

                <h3> Congratulations on installing ParselTongue, you should see a small new friend.</h3>

                <p>
                    Click on this snake to log in and out of ParselTongue, modify your settings,
                    or go back to the about page.

                <h3> ParselTongue works on top of gmail.</h3>

                <p> Your gmail will look exactly the same as it did before, except for
                one new button that appears when you write emails to other ParselTongue users.
                </p>
                <img class="screenshot-image" src="http://i.imgur.com/oD9latr.jpg"/>
                <p>
                   This snake appears when ParselTongue recognizes that you are sending an
                    email to another ParselTongue user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you click the snake, ParselTongue will encrypt your email, and a lock
                    will appear where the snake was. Although the email will look the same to you,
                    whenever the lock is visible this tells you that your email is encrypted,
                    and only you and your email's recipients will be able to read it.
                </p>
                 <img class="screenshot-image" src="http://i.imgur.com/pEMhIWG.jpg"/>

                <p>
                    If you click the lock again, it will unencrypt your message so you can send an email as plain text.
                </p>
                <p> From the ParselTongue extension popup you can set whether you would like
                emails to other ParselTongue users to be encrypted by default, or if you want to
                explicitly click the snake on each email you want to encrypt.</p>
